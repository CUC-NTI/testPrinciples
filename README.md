# Introduction 简介

# Principles are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow answers to specific questions. Every game has principles that successful players master to achieve winning results. So does life. Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life. Those who understand more of them and understand them well know how to interact with the world more effectively than those who know fewer of them or know them less well. Different principles apply to different aspects of life - e.g., there are "skiing principles" for skiing, "parenting principles" for parenting, "management principles" for managing, “investment principles” for investing, etc - and there are over - arching "life principles" that influence our approaches to all things. And, of course, different people subscribe to different principles that they believe work best. 

# 原则是能够在相似场景下反复运用的一套概念，有别于具体问题的狭义回答。每个游戏的获胜者都有自己遵循的原则，生活也是如此。原则是应对自然或生活规律的种种方式。对原则理解越透彻，越能在生活中游刃有余。生活的不同方面也有各自的原则，例如滑雪有“滑雪原则”，做父母的有“父母原则”，管理有“管理原则，投资有“投资原则”等等，也存在支配一切，包罗万象的“生活原则”。当然每个人都有自己认为最有效的原则。
