What follows are three distinct parts that can be read either independently or as a connected whole. Part 1 is about the purpose and importance of having principles in general, having nothing to do with mine. Part 2 explains my most fundamental life principles that apply to everything I do. Part 3, explains my management principles as they are being lived out at Bridgewater. Since my management principles are simply my most fundamental life principles applied to management, reading Part 2 will help you to better understand Part 3, but it’s not required—you can go directly to Part 3 to see what my management principles are and how Bridgewater has been run. One day I’d like to write a Part 4 on my investment principles. If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck \(i.e., understanding for the effort\), I suggest that you read Parts 1 and 2, and the beginning of Part 3 \(through the Summary and Table of Principles\) which will give you nearly the whole picture. It’s only about 55 pages of a normal size book.  
  
本书分为三个章节，可单独阅读每个章节，也可以从头读到尾。第一章整体讲述了有原则的目的和重要性，这些和我自己的原则无关。第二章阐述了围绕我生活方方面面的最重要的根本原则。第三章详述了我管理桥水联合基金公司时遵循的管理原则。我的管理原则其实就是根本生活原则在管理领域的应用，因此阅读第二章将有助于对第三章的理解。当然，你也可以直接阅读第三章，看看我都有哪些管理原则，桥水联合基金是如何基于这些原则进行管理的。未来有一天，我可能会写第四章，聊聊我在投资领域的原则。如果你想尽快读到最多的干货，建议你读第一章和第二章后，阅读第三章从总结到原则汇总列表的内容，这些一共也就正常书籍大小的55页，涵盖了全书的精华。
