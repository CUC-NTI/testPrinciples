## Part 3: My Management Principles 第三章：我的管理原则 {#part-3-my-management-principles-br-%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E7%AB%A0%EF%BC%9A%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%99}

  
In Part 1 I explained why I believe having principles is important and that I believe that it is up to each person to decide what principles are best for them. In Part 2 I explained my most fundamental principles. In this part I explain my management principles. Naturally, my management principles reflect the principles I believe are best throughout my life. But before I get into my particular management principles, I’d like to touch on management principles in general.  
  
在第一章中，我详述了具备原则的重要性，每个人要自己决定最适合自己的原则。第二章我详述了对我来说最重要的根本原则。本章将详述我的管理原则。实际上我的管理原则反映出了我一生中最坚信的一些原则。在开展论述之前，我先大概谈谈管理原则。

  
If you read any of the earlier parts you know that I believe that having principles is essential for getting what you want out of life. That is as true for groups of people \(e.g., companies, schools, governments, foundations, etc.\) as it is for individuals. While individuals operating individually can choose whatever values and principles they like, when working in a group the people must agree on the group’s values and principles. If the group is not clear about them, confusion and eventually gravitation toward the population’s averages will result. If the group’s values and principles are clear, their way of being \(i.e., their culture\) will permeate everything they do. It will drive how the people in the group set goals, identify problems, diagnose problems, design solutions and make sure that these designs are implemented. So I believe this relationship looks like this:  
  
你要是读了前面两章就会明白，我认为要实现梦想，具备原则极其重要，不仅是个人，对于团队来说也是如此，包括公司、学校、政府、基金会等。个人在做抉择时能根据自身喜好选择价值观和原则，但在团队里工作则要认同团队的价值观和原则。如果一个团队对其价值观和原则不够清晰明朗，随之带来的后果终会落到每个成员身上。团队的价值观和原则一旦清晰明了，团队的工作方式（也就是团队文化）将渗透于团队的方方面面，包括如何制定目标、发现问题、诊断问题、设计解决方案、落实方案。我认为团队里关系应该是这样的：

While having a clearly conveyed**great culture**is important, that’s only half of the magic formula. The other half is having**great people**—i.e., people who have the values, abilities, skills that fit the organization’s culture.  
  
清晰传递团队的**良好文化**非常重要，但这只是“魔法公式”的一半，另一半是**优秀的员工**，他们的价值观、能力、技能都和公司文化相得益彰。
