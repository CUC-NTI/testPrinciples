## Part 1: The Importance of Principles 第一章 原则的重要性 {#part-1-the-importance-of-principles-br-%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E7%AB%A0-%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%99%E7%9A%84%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%80%A7}

  
I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life. I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles.That is why I believe we need to talk about them.  
  
我认为，掌握原则对于实现人生理想至关重要，我相信要想知己知彼，也必须了解彼此的处事原则。在我看来，这就是为什么原则问题值得一谈的原因。

  
We will begin by examining the following questions:  
  
先来看看下面几个问题吧：

  
**What are principles?**  
  
**原则是什么 ？**

  
**Why are principles important?**  
  
**原则为何重要？**

  
**Where do principles come from?**  
  
**原则来自何处？**

  
**Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?**  
  
**你生活中有恪守的原则么，都有哪些？**

  
**How well do you think they will work, and why?**  
  
**这些原则你认为行之有效么，为什么？**

  
Answer all questions with complete honesty, without worrying what I or others might think. That honesty will allow you to be comfortable living with your own principles, and to judge yourself by how consistently you operate by them. If you don’t have many well-thought-out principles, don’t worry. We will get there together, if we remain open-minded.  
  
回答上述问题时，无需担忧我或别人会怎么想。坦诚回答就好，坦诚面对自己的处事原则才能与之和谐相处，才能判断自己的行为是否不违背原则。即使你没有太多深思熟虑的原则也没关系.请随我一起解放思想，建立属于你自己的原则。

  
I wish everyone wrote down their principles. I wish I could read and compare the principles of all the people I’m interested in— Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, people running for political office, people I share my life with, etc. I'd love to know what they value most and what principles they use to get what they want. Imagine how great that would be—e.g. imagine how much valuable fundamental thinking could be harnessed. I hope that my doing this will encourage others to do the same.  
  
我希望大家都能写下自己的原则。我希望能够知道所有我感兴趣的人写下的原则是什么，像是史蒂夫·乔布斯，阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦，竞选从政之人，与我共度一生之人等，希望可以拿我的原则和他们的原则进行比较。我很想知道他们最珍视什么，实现梦想时都遵循什么原则。想一想都觉得棒极了，这汇总起来对我自己的思维该多有价值啊。我希望我写的原则能够鼓励其他人也将自己的原则写下来。

###  1\) What are principles?  1\) 原则是什么？ {#-br-1-what-are-principles-br-br-1-%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%99%E6%98%AF%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%EF%BC%9F}

  
Your values are what you consider important, literally what you “value.” Principles are what allow you to live a life consistent with those values. Principles connect your values to your actions; they are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices.  
  
价值观是你认为重要的、“有价值”的东西，而在生活中若想顺从自己的价值观，我们需要的就是原则。原则连接价值观与行动，它如指引行动的灯塔，帮你成功应对现实生活中的条条框框。当面临两难抉择之时，遵循原则就能迎刃而解。

###  2）Why are principles important?  2）原则为何重要？ {#-br-2%EF%BC%89why-are-principles-important-br-br-2%EF%BC%89%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%99%E4%B8%BA%E4%BD%95%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%EF%BC%9F}

  
All successful people operate by principles that help them be successful. Without principles, you would be forced to react to circumstances that come at you without considering what you value most and how to make choices to get what you want. This would prevent you from making the most of your life. While operating without principles is bad for individuals, it is even worse for groups of individuals \(such as companies\) because it leads to people randomly bumping into each other without understanding their own values and how to behave in order to be consistent with those values.  
  
成功人士恪守帮助他们成功的一套原则。如果没有原则，那么当你面临抉择之时，你将变得非常被动，因为你不知道自己最珍视什么，面对选择也无从下手。如此一来，就更别谈实现人生价值了。个人处事没有原则已经很糟糕了，而集体（如公司）处事没有原则就更糟糕了，因为在这样的集体中，大家在根本不了解各自的价值观的情况下就凑到一起，行为处事也无法同各自的价值观相匹配。
